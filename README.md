# Evacuation Simulator

FFMPEG must be installed and available in your system PATH for video generation to work. If you don't pass the --video argument when running the simulation, no video will be generated and FFMPEG is not required.

For a list of command line options, from the `src` directory, run: `python main.py --help`.
